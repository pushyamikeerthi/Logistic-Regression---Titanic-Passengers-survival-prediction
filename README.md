# Logistic-Regression---Titanic-Passengers-survival-prediction
In 1912, the British passenger ship Titanic struck an iceberg, which led to the death of over 1,500 passengers and crew, more than half the people on board.

Constructed a model with Logistic Regression using WOE and IV that uses available data about the passengers to predict their survival.

Dataset used: titanic_dataset.csv (more information about this dataset is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
Fited  initial model, and identify and remove from consideration predictors that are not significant.
Plotted a ROC curve and find the optimal cutoff probability
Updated  predictions using the optimal cutoff
Finally, created a confusion matrix using your final predictions
